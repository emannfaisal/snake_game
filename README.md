I used turtle and oop to create thsi project.The scoreboard class increments the score every time the snake touches the food.
The food class is used to make the food and locate it to random positions
similarily,the snake class makes the snake and handles the functionality of increasing its size everytime it touches the food.
The main file has objects of these classes and uses them to call the functions
